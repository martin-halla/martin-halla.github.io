Analysis and numerical methods for partial differential equations
------------

  * Wave equations (acoustics, elasticity, electromagnetism, plasmonics, stellar oscillations)  
  * Eigenvalue problems (holomorphic, non-selfadjoint EVPs; existence and approximation of EVs)  
  * Transparent boundary conditions (perfectly matched layers, infinite elements; backward, anisotropic waves)  
  * Compatible discretizations (T-coercivity; Galbrunâ€™s equation, nonstandard Maxwell problems)  
  * Target signatures in inverse scattering (transmission eigenvalues, Steklov eigenvalues; linear sampling, inside outside-duality)
