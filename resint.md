Analysis and numerical methods for partial differential equations
------------

* __Wave equations__ (acoustics, elasticity, electromagnetism, plasmonics, stellar oscillations)  
* __Eigenvalue problems__ (holomorphic, non-selfadjoint EVPs; existence, stability  and approximation of EVs)  
* __Transparent boundary conditions__ (perfectly matched layers, infinite elements; backward, anisotropic waves)  
* __Compatible discretizations__ (T-coercivity; Galbrunâ€™s equation, sign-changing coefficients, nonstandard Maxwell problems)  
* __Target signatures in inverse scattering__ (transmission EVs, Steklov EVs; linear sampling, inside outside duality)
