Analysis and numerical methods for partial differential equations
------------

* Wave equations (acoustics, elasticity, electromagnetism, plasmonics, stellar oscillations)  
* Eigenvalue problems (holomorphic, non-selfadjoint EVPs; existence, stability  and approximation of EVs)  
* Transparent boundary conditions (perfectly matched layers, infinite elements; backward, anisotropic waves)  
* Compatible discretizations (T-coercivity; Galbrunâ€™s equation, nonstandard Maxwell problems)  
* Target signatures in inverse scattering (transmission EVs, Steklov EVs; linear sampling, inside outside duality)
